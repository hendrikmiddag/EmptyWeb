# EmptyWeb
As part of Flutje a Azure (almost) empty website, to try several web connectors. Developed for fun based on learning from a project I've worked on and hosted in Microsoft Azure. Idea behind is to try several ways to return HTTP content to requester.

## Getting Started
Developed with Visual Studio 2019 on .NetFX 4.8 running on ASP.NET.
Project is configured such that it runs with IIS Express.

## Deployment
Deployment is support on many ways but best it runs with a webserver supporting the ASP.NET

## Versioning
Only use the file version, assembly version remains untouched to support interoperability.
File version use the year.month.day.build, just for fun.
